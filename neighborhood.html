			<h1>What's all the buzz about Frisco, Texas?</h1>
			<span id="mainTitleContainer">
				<span id="titleDesc">Frisco is a city in Texas and part of the Dallas-Fort Worth metro area. Downtown, the
					Frisco Heritage Museum displays antiques, vintage cars and railroad memorabilia. The National Videogame
					Museum has rare gaming consoles and arcade machines. Next door, Sci-Tech Discovery Center offers
					hands-on exhibits for kids. To the northeast, Frisco Commons Park features playgrounds, a fishing pond
					and an amphitheater.</span>

								<p class="description">Sunshine is here,
									which means it’s time to get outside and explore! One of the best places to get some
									fresh
									air
									in Frisco is at HALL Park. On the surface, HALL Park is an upscale business park for
									several
									prominent local and national corporations; however, the real treasure of this hidden gem
									are
									the
									beautiful walking trails that circle around a series of large ponds full of wildlife and
									fountains. Located in the heart of Frisco, adjacent to The Star, the immense grounds of
									HALL
									Park are immaculately kept, usually low-trafficked, and are a true joy to come across in
									such a
									busy, booming area of the city.

								<p class="description">This
									hidden gem recently got a huge facelift, making it more entertaining
									for little and big kids, alike. Bi Centennial Park now features several zip lines,
									triple-deck
									play structure with tall slides, an elevated merry-go-round (it’s so cool!), and
									face-to-face
									double swings. Bi Centennial also includes a basketball court, street hockey rink, and
									covered
									pavilion with tables.

								<p class="description">This is our summertime go-to park because it has everything we need
									for
									hours of fun. Spray park to beat the summer heat? Check! Play area if the kids want a
									break
									from
									the water? Check! Picnic tables and pavilion for lunch? Check! There is rarely more than
									a
									handful of people at this park, which makes it a hidden gem you need to visit soon! Pro
									tip:
									To
									activate the water features, you have to press and hold the black sensor at the top of
									the
									blue
									pole located on the western side of the spray park area. Also, water shoes are highly
									recommended, as there are a number of trees (yay, shade!) that drop acorns or sticks on
									the
									spray park area.

									features sidewalk engravings of fun, easy-to-read poems. A covered pavilion with tables
									is a
									great place for a snack and for parents to escape the sun as their little ones splash
